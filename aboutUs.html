        <p>Exercise proposed by Hack A Boss:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The initial game (level 1) should show 16 cards, refered to 8 pairs of cards with
            an emoji icon each.
          </li>
          <li>The cards are initially "covered", only a gray box is visible.</li>
          <li>
            You can click on 2 cards and the emoji they contain will be revealed.
          </li>
          <li>
            If both of them have the same emoji, they will remain uncovered, otherwise,
            they will be hidden again after 1 second.
          </li>
          <li>
            The game goes on, revealing 2 cards at the same time, until all pairs are
            found.
          </li>
          <li>The game must keep track of attempts made.</li>
          <li> The final result is the number of attempts made. The better that score is (at least it can be 8) the better.</li>
        </ul>

      <p>We have managed to complete what the Hack A Boss instructions asked for, and also implemented:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An error counter.</li>
        <li>A Pop Up at the end of the level that gives the options of:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Start the level again (restart).</li>
            <li>Go up to the next level (nex level), up to a total of 3:</li>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Level 1:</b> 16 cards, 8 pairs.</li>
                <li><b>Level 2:</b> 20 cards, 10 pairs.</li>
                <li><b>Level 3:</b> 24 cards, 12 pairs.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Close the Pop Up (close).</li>
          </ul>
        <li>A side navigation menu which includes all this premises and:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>A restart button for those who would like to repeat the game to get a better score</li>
            <li>A section (this one) with more information about this project.</li>
          </ul>
