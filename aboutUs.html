      Exercise proposed by Hack A Boss:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The game should show 16 cards corresponding to 8 pairs of cards with
          an emoji icon each.
        </li>
        <li>The cards are initially "covered", only a gray box is visible.</li>
        <li>
          You can click on 2 cards and the emoji they contain will be revealed.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the 2 cards have the same emoji, they remain uncovered, otherwise
          they are hidden again after 1 second.
        </li>
        <li>
          Play continues, revealing cards 2 at a time until all pairs are
          revealed.
        </li>
        <li>The game must keep track of attempts made.</li>
        <li> The final result is the number of attempts made. The better that score is (at least it can be 8) the better.</li>
      </ul>

      Our team has managed to complete what the Hack A Boss instructions asked
      for, and they are also implemented:
      <ul>
        <li>An error counter.</li>
        <li>A Pop Up at the end of the level that gives the options of:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Start the level again (restart).</li>
            <li>Go up to the next level (nex level), up to a total of 3:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Level 1: 16 cards, 8 pairs.</li>
                <li>Level 2: 20 cards, 10 pairs.</li>
                <li>Level 3: 24 cards, 12 pairs.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Close the Pop Up (close).</li>
          </ul>
        <li>A side navigation menu that implements the above options and:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The restart option to restart the game with the counters at 0.</li>
            <li>A section with more information about this project.</li>
          </ul>
